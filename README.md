This project focuses on implementing a K-nearest-neighbor in order to classify my football position using data from `Kaggle`,
the model compares dimentions between me and players (Age, Shooting, Passing ... etc) in order to gauge and classify the position.

Note: The core of the project is to showoff the KNN model, however Linear Regression was used to predict my overall stat as well.


Thank you for your time
